## MEDD 412 Weekly Objectives
*Tejas Phaterpekar*

The purpose of this repository is to practice using spacy and explore the MEDD 412 weekly objectives.

Some tasks I want to accomplish are:
- split pdf into a df (most likely with sentences)
- get word frequencies
- group objectives with appropriate links
